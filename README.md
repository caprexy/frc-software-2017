# frc-software-2017
FRC Team 3061's software for the 2017 season.

`master` contains the code that was actually tun on our robot, Victoria, at the 2017 Little Rock and Midwest Regionals.

`development` contains code related to using `adb` and vision alignment to try and place gears on pegs. This code broke our robot (we believe that some of the TCP Connections would not timeout in Begin.vi but we are not sure).
